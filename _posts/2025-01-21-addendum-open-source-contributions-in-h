After my recent article on coding tests, I read a [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/james-mahy_stop-using-github-contributions-in-hiring-activity-7280527334883962880-esvT) that was critical of using GitHub activity as a factor in hiring. The author raised some interesting points, suggesting that contributions don’t always reflect motivation, skill, or tenacity, and may even be misleading. My own experience leads me to a different perspective.

I’ve been contributing to open source for almost two decades. It’s taught me a great deal about real-world problem-solving, communication, and collaboration. Reviewing a candidate’s contributions—whether personal projects, pull requests, or issues can reveal insights into their creativity, communication skills, and technical mindset. This applies equally to junior developers; even small projects or issues can demonstrate qualities like passion, curiosity, intelligence, diligence, empathy, humility, and respect.

That said, I agree with the author that open source contributions should not be a requirement. Plenty of excellent developers don’t engage in open source for various reasons. But if someone has made meaningful contributions, I want to hear about them. For me, it’s less about the green squares and more about the stories behind them, what interests they have, what challenges they faced, and how they approached them.

Open source is just one piece of the puzzle, but it’s often a fascinating one, and I believe it can be a valuable part of the hiring conversation, no matter what the candidate's level of experience.
