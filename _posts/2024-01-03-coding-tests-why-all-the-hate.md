Hiring software engineers is one of the most challenging and critical responsibilities for any team. Having founded a consultancy and led hiring for other companies, I know first-hand how much is at stake. A wrong hire can delay work, frustrate teams, and cost both significant time and money. It is not good for the candidate either; being in the wrong role causes anxiety, damages confidence, and leaves a blemish on their career history. Furthermore, dealing with someone who underperforms is disrupting, demoralising and exhausting for their manager, their colleagues, and the person themselves. Conversely, a robust hiring process means that successful candidates get to work on interesting projects with great colleagues and vice versa. This is why it is in everyone’s interest that the process is effective.

However, the methods used in hiring have faced increasing scrutiny, particularly coding tests, whether take-home or pairing. While these methods are not perfect, dismissing them outright risks missing valuable insights. Let me explore some of these debates and how thoughtful hiring processes can strike a balance.

### Coding Tests: A Flexible Approach

A common complaint about hiring practices is the stress caused by live coding exercises or the burden of take-home projects, especially for those with limited time due to family or other commitments. My preferred approach addresses both concerns by offering flexibility.

I provide candidates with the coding test beforehand. At a minimum, I ask them to read the exercise and come prepared with their environment ready to go, for example, tools and dependencies installed. If they prefer, they can complete the test in advance and walk through their solution during the interview, although I will ask them to make changes so I can observe them work. This allows:

- Time-poor candidates to do the minimum and focus on live problem-solving,
- Candidates who feel anxious to prepare more thoroughly in advance.

This approach gives candidates control over how they prepare and ensures I can still evaluate problem-solving skills, adaptability, and hands-on coding ability.

### Why a Live Coding Test Is So Important

One of the most revealing parts of the interview process is watching how candidates use their toolchain (computer, IDE, command line, etc). An experienced software engineer develops a kind of muscle memory, navigating their environment with ease and efficiency. Whether it is memorised shortcuts, efficient workflows, favourite packages, or thoughtful organisation, these details strongly correlate with hands-on experience. They demonstrate not only a candidate’s technical skill but also their approach to problem-solving and familiarity with their craft. It is not about perfection; it is about the habits and fluency that only come from practice.

A live coding test allows me to observe these behaviours in action. It shows how candidates approach a problem, how they structure their code, and how they troubleshoot unexpected issues. It also provides insight into their communication skills and how they handle feedback, both of which are critical in collaborative environments. In some cases, it can even reveal red flags about a candidate’s attitude or willingness to adapt. For instance, a candidate who ignores feedback may not be the right fit for a team-oriented culture.

### GitHub Contributions

GitHub contributions are another contentious topic in hiring. Critics argue that they disadvantage candidates who do not code outside work, often due to family or other commitments. It is a valid concern, however, GitHub contributions can offer valuable insights when used appropriately.

For example, engineers working in environments that leverage open source may have reported issues, submitted pull requests, or even authored their own libraries. Reviewing a candidate's issues for tone of voice, clarity and detail (with allowance for non-native speakers) can reveal intelligence, diligence, curiousity, humility, empathy, and respect. In some cases, a GitHub profile demonstrating good communication and clean code can remove the need for a coding test. That said, the absence of GitHub contributions should not penalise candidates, as it does not necessarily reflect a lack of capability or potential.

### Final Thoughts

To paraphrase Warren Buffett, at the heart of any good hiring process is the search for intelligence, energy, and integrity. Depending on the level of role, knowledge and wisdom become increasingly important too. No hiring process will ever be perfect at evaluating these criteria, but thoughtful adjustments, like offering flexible coding tests, observing how candidates use their tools, and researching GitHub contributions, can make the process more effective. The goal is to use these tools not as rigid gatekeepers but as opportunities to learn about candidates and identify those who will thrive in your team.
