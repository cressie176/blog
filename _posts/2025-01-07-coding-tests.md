Hiring software engineers is one of the most challenging and critical responsibilities for any team. Having founded a consultancy and led hiring for other companies, I know first-hand how much is at stake. A wrong hire can delay work, frustrate teams, and cost both significant time and money. It is not good for the candidate either. Being in the wrong role causes anxiety, damages confidence, and leaves a blemish on their career history. Furthermore, dealing with someone who underperforms is disruptive, demoralising and exhausting for their manager, their colleagues, and the person themselves. Conversely, a good hiring process means that successful candidates get to work on interesting projects with great colleagues and vice versa. This is why it is in everyone’s interest that the process is effective.

However, the methods used in hiring have faced increasing scrutiny, particularly coding tests, whether take-home or live. While these methods are not perfect, dismissing them outright risks missing valuable insights. Let me explore some of these debates and how thoughtful hiring processes can strike a balance.

### Common Criticisms of Coding Tests

Common criticisms of coding tests include:

- **Anxiety:** Many candidates experience stress caused by live coding exercises, which can lead to underperformance during interviews.

- **Time constraints:** Take-home projects can be burdensome, especially for those with limited time due to family or other commitments. An ex-colleague even refused to interview for companies who set take-home tests.

- **Unrealistic tests:** Many coding tests focus on niche skills like recursion or bit masking that are rarely used in day-to-day work. These tests often fail to measure a candidate’s ability to perform in real-world scenarios, leaving a gap in assessing their practical effectiveness.

### Why a Live Coding Test Is Valuable

One of the most revealing parts of a coding interview is observing candidates using their toolchain (computer, IDE, command line, etc). An experienced software engineer develops a kind of muscle memory, navigating their environment with ease and efficiency. Whether it is memorised shortcuts, efficient workflows, favourite packages, or thoughtful organisation, these details strongly correlate with hands-on experience. They demonstrate not only a candidate’s technical skill but also their approach to problem-solving and familiarity with their craft. It is not about perfection; it is about the habits and fluency that only come from practice.

A live coding test allows me to observe these behaviours in action. It shows how candidates approach a problem, how they structure their code, and how they troubleshoot unexpected issues. It also provides insight into their communication skills and how they handle feedback, both of which are critical in collaborative environments.

In some cases, it can reveal red flags about a candidate. For instance, I have encountered several candidates who ignored feedback, which raised concerns about their adaptability and willingness to engage constructively. In another example, I asked a candidate to adapt their in-memory solution to one using persistence with a datastore of their choice. To my surprise, they responded with exasperation, raising serious concerns about their suitability for a collaborative, team-oriented culture.

### Coding Tests: A Flexible Approach

My preferred approach addresses the concerns around live and take-home tests by offering flexibility. I use tests that do not require company domain knowledge but do demonstrate frequently used software engineering skills. These tests are tailored to the experience level of the role, ensuring they are both relevant and fair. Candidates are encouraged to use whatever resources they have available, including Google, Stack Overflow, and AI tools. I always attempt the test myself to ensure its appropriateness and feasibility. Additionally, at least one existing employee of the appropriate level is asked to attempt it as well. I also try to put the candidate at ease prior to starting the live aspect of the test, rather than jumping straight in and advising them that it is not necessary to finish.

I provide candidates with the coding test beforehand. At a minimum, I ask them to read the exercise and come prepared with their environment ready to go. If they prefer, they can complete the test in advance and walk through their solution during the interview, although I will ask them to make changes so I can observe them work. This allows:

- Time-poor candidates to do the minimum and focus on live problem-solving,

- Candidates who feel anxious to prepare more thoroughly in advance.

This approach gives candidates control over how they prepare and ensures I can still evaluate problem-solving skills, adaptability, and hands-on coding ability. Additionally, I have offered a second chance to candidates who suffered badly due to nerves but who performed well otherwise.

### Final Thoughts

I have deliberately avoided discussing other important aspects of the hiring process, such as DEI considerations, non-technical criteria, and the understanding that a good interview is a mutual evaluation. These are crucial topics, but they warrant a separate discussion. Here, I chose to focus purely on the appropriateness and importance of coding exercises to ensure clarity and depth on this specific aspect of hiring.

To paraphrase Warren Buffett, at the heart of any good hiring process is the search for intelligence, energy, and integrity. Depending on the level of role, knowledge and wisdom become increasingly important too. No hiring process will ever be perfect at evaluating these criteria, but thoughtful adjustments, like offering flexible coding tests, observing how candidates use their tools, and researching GitHub contributions, can make the process more effective. The goal is to use these tools not as rigid gatekeepers but as opportunities to learn about candidates and identify those who will thrive in your team.
